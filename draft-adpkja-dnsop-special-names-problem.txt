             Problem Statement for Special-Use Domain Names
              draft-adpkja-dnsop-special-names-problem-00

Abstract

   The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the
   Domain Name System (DNS).  However, other protocols exist that are
   fundamentally different from the DNS, but which have syntactically-
   similar namespaces.

   When an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system which
   supports multiple, different protocols for name resolution, it is
   desirable that the protocol to be used is unambiguous, and that
   requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently addressed
   using another.

   RFC 6761 introduced a framework by which, under certain
   circumstances, a particular domain name could be acknowledged as
   being special.  This framework has been used to make a reservation (a
   part of the DNS namespace that should not be used) to accommodate
   non-DNS name resolution protocols and avoid the possibility of
   namespace collisions.

   Various challenges have become apparent with the application of the
   guidance provided in RFC 6761 to real world protocols and namespaces.
   This document aims to document those challenges in the form of a
   problem statement, to facilitate discussion of future improvements to
   RFC 6761.

Internet-Draft     Special-Use Names Problem Statement    September 2015


1.  Introduction

   The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the
   Domain Name System (DNS), as originally specified in [RFC1034] and
   [RFC1035].  However, other protocols exist that are fundamentally
   different from the DNS, but which have syntactically-similar
   namespaces.

   When an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system which
   supports multiple, different protocols for name resolution, it is
   desirable that the protocol to be used is unambiguous, and that
   requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently addressed
   using another.

   [RFC6761] introduced a framework by which, under certain
   circumstances, a particular domain name could be acknowledged as
   being special.  This framework has been used to make a reservation (a
   part of the DNS namespace that should not be used) to accommodate
   non-DNS name resolution protocols and avoid the possibility of
   namespace collisions.

   [RFC6761] describes seven questions which should be considered when
   deciding whether a domain name is special.  Domain names that are
   acknowledged to be special are inserted into the "Special-Use Domain
   Names" registry.  The initial contents of that registry included 25
   entries, four of which were top-level domains ("TEST", "LOCALHOST",
   "INVALID" and "EXAMPLE").  Since the publication of [RFC6761], the
