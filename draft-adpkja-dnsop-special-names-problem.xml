    <abstract>
      <t>The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet
	is the Domain Name System (DNS). However, other protocols
	exist that are fundamentally different from the DNS, but
	which have syntactically-similar namespaces.</t>

      <t>When an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system
        which supports multiple, different protocols for name resolution,

        that requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently
        addressed using another.</t>

      <t>RFC 6761 introduced a framework by which, under certain
	circumstances, a particular domain name could be acknowledged
	as being special. This framework has been used to make a
	reservation (a part of the DNS namespace that should not
	be used) to accommodate non-DNS name resolution protocols
	and avoid the possibility of namespace collisions.</t>

      <t>Various challenges have become apparent with the application
	of the guidance provided in RFC 6761 to real world protocols
	and namespaces. This document aims to document those
	challenges in the form of a problem statement, to facilitate
	discussion of future improvements to RFC 6761.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet
	is the Domain Name System (DNS), as originally specified
	in <xref target="RFC1034"/> and <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
	However, other protocols exist that are fundamentally
	different from the DNS, but which have syntactically-similar
	namespaces.</t>

      <t>When an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system
        which supports multiple, different protocols for name resolution,
        it is desirable that the protocol to be used is unambiguous, and
        that requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently
        addressed using another.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6761"/> introduced a framework by which,
	under certain circumstances, a particular domain name could
	be acknowledged as being special. This framework has been
	used to make a reservation (a part of the DNS namespace
	that should not be used) to accommodate non-DNS name
	resolution protocols and avoid the possibility of namespace
	collisions.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC6761"/> describes seven questions which
	should be considered when deciding whether a domain name
	is special.  Domain names that are acknowledged to be special
	are inserted into the "Special-Use Domain Names" registry.
	The initial contents of that registry included 25 entries,
	four of which were top-level domains ("TEST", "LOCALHOST",
	"INVALID" and "EXAMPLE"). Since the publication of <xref
	target="RFC6761"/>, the top-level domain names "LOCAL" <xref
	target="RFC6762"/> and "ONION" <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-onion-tld"/> were added.</t>

      <t>While some of the entries in the Special-Use Domain Names
	registry document use of a DNS-like namespace by non-DNS
	name resolution protocols (LOCALHOST, LOCAL, ONION), other
	entries are included for different reasons (e.g. EXAMPLE.ORG,
	EXAMPLE.COM and EXAMPLE.NET are reserved for use in
	documentation).</t>

      <t>This document specifically explores the problems in the
	use of <xref target="RFC6761"/> to justify the reservation
	of top-level domains in the DNS. Use of <xref target="RFC6761"/>
	with reference to other domain names is not discussed.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>Clear and unambiguous use of terminology is important for
	the clear formulation of any problem statement. The DNS
	protocol suffers from imprecise and overloaded terminology
	(e.g. see <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology"/>)
	without confusing matters further with terms and concepts
	from other naming systems that are similar, but different.</t>

      <t>The following terms used in this document are to be
        interpreted as follows:

        <list style="hanging">
          <t>Aardvark (n): a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal
            native to Africa; the only living species of the order
            Tubulidentata.</t>
