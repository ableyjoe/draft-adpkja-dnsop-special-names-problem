             Problem Statement for Special-Use Domain Names
              draft-adpkja-dnsop-special-names-problem-00

Abstract

   The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the
   Domain Name System (DNS).  However, other protocols exist that are
   fundamentally different from the DNS, but which have syntactically-
   similar namespaces.

   When an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system which
   supports multiple, different protocols for name resolution, it is
   desirable that the protocol to be used is unambiguous, and that
   requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently addressed
   using another.

   RFC 6761 introduced a framework by which, under certain
   circumstances, a particular domain name could be acknowledged as
   being special.  This framework has been used to make top-level domain
   reservations, that is, particular top-level domains that should not
   be used within the DNS to accommodate parallel use of non-DNS name
   resolution protocols by end-users and avoid the possibility of
   namespace collisions.

   Various challenges have become apparent with this application of the
   guidance provided in RFC 6761.  This document aims to document those
   challenges in the form of a problem statement, to facilitate further
   discussion of potential solutions.

1.  Terminology

   Clear and unambiguous use of terminology is important for the clear
   formulation of any problem statement.  The DNS protocol suffers from
   imprecise and overloaded terminology (e.g. see
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology]) without confusing matters further
   with terms and concepts from other naming systems that are similar,
   but different.

   In the interests of clarity, the following terms used in this
   document are to be interpreted as follows:

      Aardvark (n): a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native
      to Africa; the only living species of the order Tubulidentata.
      See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardvark>.

      Registry (n): the Special-Use Domain Names Registry created by
      [RFC6761] and published at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
      special-use-domain-names/special-use-domain-names.xhtml>

2.  Introduction

   The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the
   Domain Name System (DNS), as originally specified in [RFC1034] and
   [RFC1035].  However, other protocols exist that are fundamentally
   different from the DNS, but which have syntactically-similar
   namespaces.

   When an end-user triggers resolution of a name on a system which
   supports multiple, different protocols for name resolution, it is
   desirable that the protocol to be used is unambiguous, and that
   requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently addressed
   using another.

   [RFC6761] introduced a framework by which, under certain
   circumstances, a particular domain name could be acknowledged as
   being special.  This framework has been used to make a reservation (a
   part of the DNS namespace that should not be used by the DNS
   protocol) to accommodate non-DNS name resolution protocols and to
   avoid the possibility of namespace collisions.

   [RFC6761] describes seven questions which should be considered when
   deciding whether a domain name is special.  Domain names that are
   acknowledged to be special are inserted into the Registry, the
   initial contents of which included 25 entries, four of which were
   top-level domains ("TEST", "LOCALHOST", "INVALID" and "EXAMPLE").
   Since the publication of [RFC6761], the top-level domain names
   "LOCAL" [RFC6762] and "ONION" [I-D.ietf-dnsop-onion-tld] were added.

   While some of the entries in the Registry document the use of a DNS-
   like namespace by non-DNS name resolution protocols (LOCALHOST,
   LOCAL, ONION), other entries are included for different reasons (e.g.
   EXAMPLE.ORG, EXAMPLE.COM and EXAMPLE.NET are reserved for use in
   documentation).

   This document specifically explores the problems in the use of
   [RFC6761] to justify the reservation of top-level domains in the DNS.
   Use of [RFC6761] with reference to other domain names is not
   discussed.

3.  Clear and Specific Guidelines

   [RFC6761] (section 5) describes seven questions to be answered in
   order to provide clear guidance about how and why a particular domain
   name is special.  These seven questions can be broadly categorised as
   follows:

   1.  impact on end-users;

   2.  impact on applications;

   3.  impact on name resolution APIs and libraries;

   4.  impact on recursive resolvers;

   5.  impact on authoritative DNS servers;

   6.  impact on DNS server operators;

   7.  impact on DNS registries and registrars.

   Answers to these seven questions provide guidance to various
   audiences on how to handle a special-use domain name once it has been
   registered.  However, they are inadequate for determining whether a
   particular domain name qualifies as being special and should be
   included in the Registry.

   Experience with the review and ultimate approval of [RFC6762] and
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-onion-tld] has revealed a need for objective criteria
   and a clear process that encourages and facilitates useful
   registrations of top-level domains in the Registry without fear of
   abuse, and with consistent and adequate consideration of all future
   requests.

4.  Evaluation Process

   [RFC6762] specifies the way in which "an IETF 'Standards Action' or
   'IESG Approval' document" should present answers to the questions
   described in Section 3, but does not describe the process by which
   the answers should be evaluated.

   For example, it is not clear whether the evaluation of a document
   which requests additions to the Registry should be performed by the
   IESG, by the IAB, by the DNSOP working group, by an ad-hoc working
   group, by expert review or any combination of those approaches.

   At the time of writing, the DNSOP working group charter does not
   clearly indicate that DNSOP is the proper venue for the evaluation to
   be carried out, although it also does not prohibit this work taking
   place there.

   As an illustration of the inconsistency that has been observed
   already, [RFC6762] was published as an AD-sponsored individual
   submission in the INT area, and the IESG evaluation record does not
   reveal any discussion of the reservation of the LOCAL top-level
   domain in the DNS; [I-D.ietf-dnsop-onion-tld], however, was published
   as a working group document through DNSOP, and an extensive
   discussion by the IESG on the merits of the request took place.

5.  Coordination between the IETF and ICANN

   The policy surrounding the implementation and management of top-level
   domains in the DNS has been developed using a multi-stakeholder
   process convened by ICANN.  At the time of writing, the process by
   which most new top-level domains are reviewed includes the ability
   for applications to be rejected on technical grounds; for example, an
   application for "LOCALHOST" would not be approved.

   Whilst discussing the particular attributes that make a domain name
   special, [RFC6761] notes that "the act of defining such a special
   name creates a higher-level protocol rule, above ICANN's management
   of allocatable names on the public Internet."  This declaration may
   well be uncontentious, perhaps accommodated by the technical review
   alluded to above.  However, a clear understanding of the operational
   coordination required to avoid conflicts seems prudent, in the
   interests of maintaining the stability of the naming system as a
   whole and protecting end-users from confusion or harm.

6.  Clear Expectations

   Each of the seven questions posed by [RFC6761] has the potential to
   expose special handling of particular queries in the DNS by
   particular audiences.  However, it is not clear what any of those
   audiences might reasonably expect as a result of a succesful request
   to add a top-level domain to the Registry.

   For example, reservation of a top-level domain by the IETF does not
   guarantee that queries for names within a reserved domain will not be
   sent over the Internet.  The requirements of the operators of
   recursive resolvers in the DNS cannot be relied upon to be
   implemented; the impact on the operators of DNS authoritative servers
   hence cannot be reliably assumed to be zero.  In the case of
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-onion-tld], leakage of ONION queries on the Internet
   might lead to disclosure of private information that, in some cases,
   might pose a risk to the personal safety of end-users.

   The Registry as published at the time of writing does not include
   direct guidance for any of the seven audiences, relying instead upon
   a reference to a published RFC that might well be opaque to many
   readers ([RFC6762] is a seventy-page protocol specification, for
   example, which is arguably not the most expressive way to set
   expectations of non-technical end-users).

   Useful reservations of top-level domains should be accompanied by the
   existence of realistic expectations of each of the seven audiences,
   and the evaluation of particular requests should consider the
   practical liklihood of those expectations being met and the
   implications if they are not.

7.  Protocol Identifiers in Names

   At the time of writing, three top-level domain names reserved by
   inclusion in the Registry are used by name resolution protocols other
   than the DNS:

   LOCALHOST  is used to refer to the host on which the name resolution
      takes place, without reference to the DNS;

   LOCAL  is used by the Multicast DNS protocol specified in [RFC6762]
      which is similar in some respects to the DNS, but which uses a
      different well-known port number and is limited to a particular
      multicast scope;

   ONION  is used to construct names that designate anonymous hidden
      services reachable via the Tor network using onion routing.

   The three name resolution protocols described above are different
   from the DNS, and the namespaces used in each naming scheme are also
   different (if similar, in some cases).  The top-level label is hence
   effectively being used as a name resolution protocol identifier.

   The lack of a more elegant way to specify a name resolution protocol
   in (for example) a URI amounts to an architectural problem.  However,
   it is not clear that this is still a problem that can be solved; it
   could be observed that in the absence of a more elegant alternative,
   a pragmatic choice to embed priotocol selectors as namespace tokens
   has effectively already been made.  Although the reservation of names
   in the DNS namespace can be made at any level, the three examples
   above demonstrate use-cases for reservation at the top-level, and
   hence that case must be considered.
